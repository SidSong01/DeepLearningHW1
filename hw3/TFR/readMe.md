for dcgan.py, it is the DCGAN model.

both FID and IS for evaluation are intergrated in wgan and dcgan

best_10_images_for_all is the foder of the best 10 images generated either by WGAN or DCGAN.

dcgan_best_pic and wgan_best_pic are the foders for seperate the images for DCGAN and WGAN. There are 10 images for each model.
