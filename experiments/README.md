This is for the homework from cpsc 8810 DeepLearning at Clemson University, Spring2020

For the running of the .pynb files, they are what their names indicates. And you can check the .ipynb for all the processes and results in the jupyter hub.
For rerunning the files, just run all the cells one by one, and then you will see all the results in the report.

For the folder named python_files, the .py files of all the codes are in it.

Thank you very much and have a nice day! :)
