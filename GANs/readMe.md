# this project is using the car pictures in cifar10 data set to build DCGAN and WGAN for generating car pictures.
email: lingyi.s@outlook.com

tensorflow 1.15
python 3.6

you can change the class # in dataSet.py to get different data from cifar10 dataset.

for dataSet.py, it is for getting the training data, save as TFRecords
for wgan.py, it is the WGAN model.
for dcgan.py, it is the DCGAN model.

TFR foder is the training data.

best_10_images_for_all is the foder of the best 10 images generated either by WGAN or DCGAN.

dcgan_best_pic and wgan_best_pic are the foders for seperate the images for DCGAN and WGAN. There are 10 images for each model.
